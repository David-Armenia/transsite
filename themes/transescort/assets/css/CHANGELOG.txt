Changelog (2025-12-28)

Single Profile (Figma):
- Removed duplicated "RIGHT CARD (FIX v2)" block.
- Removed duplicated/empty ".profile-right .profile-summary" blocks; kept one base block + one mobile override.
- Kept "GRID FIX (NO OVERFLOW)", "PROFILE-SUMMARY", and "SWIPE GALLERY (MOBILE)" sections.

Build / Structure:
- Split main.css into split/layout.css + split/profile.css.
- Built dist.css (layout + profile) and dist.min.css (trim trailing spaces + remove empty lines).

Notes:
- No aggressive CSS minification performed (safe formatting-only min).
